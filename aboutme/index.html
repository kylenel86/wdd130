    <h2>Kylene Little</h2>
    <p>Hello. I had to switch around a class so I am just now getting to this. My name is Kylene
        Little and I was raised on the Central Coast of CA just a little north of Santa Barbara. In 2015 my
        husband and I were sealed in the San Diego temple and then relocated to Utah and have been here ever
        since. We have a 6 year old daughter, Ruby who lights up our life. I work part time as a product photograhper
        for an eBay storefront. And I also do remote listings for comic books at another eBay account. It works well for my schedule
        while I'm in school.</p>
    <p>I took this course years ago but was in need of a refresher so here I am. My major is in web design and I only
        have
        4 semesters left so the end is in sight. I like to read books, watch comedy and cooking shows on TV, play with my dogI look forward to learning and helping other's this semsester!</p>
